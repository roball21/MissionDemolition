# MissionDemolition
Mission Demolition is a physics-based game from Chapter 30 of the textbook "Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development: From Concept to Playable Game with Unity and C# (3rd Edition)" by Jeremy Gibson Bond.

In the game, the player launches projectiles from a slingshot at a castle, with the goal of hitting a green goal box. To continue to the next level, the player must demolish the castle in order to reach the target area. The number of shots taken will be displayed, and the game continues until all four levels are complete.
